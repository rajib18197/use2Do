# **use2Do**

## **Project Description**

> ### It's a simple and useful `Task Management App` which imprints your 1% improvement each day. A tool that provides utilities such as create a list of tasks you want to accomplished, update and delete task if neccessary, have client side data operations: filters and sorting so that you can refine the taskList to your convinience, Mark completed when you finished a task and more. Features like these make your day more in-control over random hustle.

### Tech Stack: React JS

## **Features**

- users should be able to do all the CRUD operation (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for TasksList
- Can toggle a task whether it is done or not
- App has Client Side Data Operations: filters, sorting and paginations so that users are able to refine the tasks list with ease
- Custom form Validation to make the user experience much better
- Can Delete all tasks at once
- Can Delete all Completed tasks at once
- Can Mark all the tasks Completed at once
- leverage a design pattern: Compound Component for reusable and flexible component
- Used Composition pattern for building better layouts
- For Styling I used CSS Modules to make the UI looks clean and responsive.

## **My approaches**

- Divide the application into multiple of feature categories, In this app, there's only 1 feature category Tasks.
- Next up I drill down Tasks feature category, figured out all the features it need
- Take one feature at a time, break up that UI feature into components to separate responsibilities, think about state Management (which type: local/global) and data flow to power up the feature
- striving for reusable component whenever need arises
- Fully Responsive Design
